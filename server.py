    """
    Autonomous AI research platform with web search, X platform access, and code 
    execution. You describe goals, Grok intelligently determines which tools to use 
    and orchestrates execution strategy.
    
    CAPABILITIES
    
    WEB (3 modes):
    • web_search - Broad queries, top results (5-10s)
    • web_search_with_snippets - Quick fact-check with excerpts, no page load (3-8s)
    • browse_page - Full content extraction, specific sections (5-15s/page)
    
    X PLATFORM (5 tools - real-time info, 6-48hr ahead of web):
    
    • x_keyword_search - Advanced syntax:
      from:user to:user @mention | since:YYYY-MM-DD until:YYYY-MM-DD within_time:Nh 
      since_time:unix | min_faves:N min_retweets:N min_replies:N | filter:media|links|
      replies|verified url:domain | (A OR B) AND C -exclude "exact phrase"
      
    • x_semantic_search - AI relevance search, understands meaning beyond keywords
    • x_user_search - Find accounts by expertise/description  
    • x_thread_fetch - Complete conversation with replies (use when you need full 
      discussion context, not just individual posts)
    • x_video_view - Analyze via frames/subtitles
    
    When to use: X for real-time (<48h), expert opinions, sentiment, breaking news, 
    discussions. Web for documentation, historical info, official resources.
    
    CODE (Python 3.12 sandboxed offline):
    Data: numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels | Viz: matplotlib (data only) | ML: torch, 
    networkx | Math: sympy, mpmath | Finance: polygon, coingecko (pre-configured) | 
    Scientific: astropy, qutip, control | Other: PuLP, biopython, rdkit
    
    Use for: calculations, analysis, verification, financial metrics, structured output, 
    processing web/X data. Can combine with searches in same query.
    
    Limitations: No pip, no external network (except polygon/coingecko), no image outputs
    
    ---
    OPERATION
    
    AGENTIC: Autonomously selects tools and sequences. Don't specify "use web_search 
    then x_keyword_search" - describe your goal, Grok plans approach.
    
    Example: "What do AI researchers think about o3?" → Grok autonomously searches 
    AI researcher X accounts, checks web announcements, browses discussions, possibly 
    analyzes sentiment, synthesizes with sources.
    
    STATELESS: Zero memory between calls. Include all context in each prompt.
    ✓ Good: "Earlier research found o3 scores 75.7% on ARC-AGI at $20/task. Now 
       investigate if this cost is prohibitive - user experiences, alternatives, 
       calculate cost at scale."
    ✗ Bad: "What about the cost?" (Cost of what?)
    
    INTELLIGENT: Understands nuanced intent, domain context, implied priorities. Rich 
    context significantly improves results.
    
    SPEED: Simple 6-10s | Medium 15-30s | Complex 30-60s | Extensive 60-120s
    
    CAPACITY: Handles 10-20 item research, dozens of pages, multi-day tracking, 50+ 
    post analysis, complex calculations. Organization enables scale - structure requests 
    clearly for volume work. Response length adapts from brief answers to multi-thousand 
    word reports based on your prompt.
    
    ---
    PARAMETERS
    
    include_research_trail (default: False)
      True = Documents every query, URL, tool, reasoning, decision points
      
      Use when:
      • Complex multi-source research needing verification
      • Transparency requirements or learning strategy
      • Building foundation for follow-up work
      
      Skip when:
      • Quick lookups, speed priority, one-off queries
      • Findings sufficient without methodology
      
      Overhead: +1-3s, significantly longer response
    
    async_mode (default: True, MUST USE TRUE)
      DO NOT SET TO FALSE. Grok research takes 30 seconds to 3 minutes. MCP clients 
      timeout at 10-30 seconds. Using async_mode=False WILL FAIL with timeout errors, 
      wasting time and providing no results.
      
      True (REQUIRED) = Returns task_id immediately, research runs in background, 
                        prevents timeouts, always works reliably
      False (NEVER USE) = Waits for completion, will timeout and fail in 99.9% of cases
      
      Even "simple" queries typically take 30-60+ seconds due to web searches, page 
      loading, X API calls, and code execution. The speed estimates above (6-120s) are 
      MINIMUMS - most queries exceed MCP timeout limits.
      
      There is no valid reason to use async_mode=False in standard MCP environments. 
      Only set to False if you have explicitly configured unlimited timeout settings 
      in your MCP client (extremely rare).
      
      Workflow: grok(prompt) → task_id → wait 1-3 min → grok_check_task(task_id) → results
      
      Storage: 24h max, 100 tasks
    
    ---
    PROMPTING
    
    CONTEXT (dramatically improves results):
    Include: Why asking, background/expertise, what you'll do with info, what you 
    already know, conversation continuity
    
    Example: "I'm evaluating ML frameworks for production. Python experience but new 
    to ML infrastructure. Research..." vs just "Research ML frameworks"
    
    ADAPTIVE STYLE:
    Simple → "Bitcoin price" | Medium → "Research [topic] checking X experts and web 
    docs" | Complex → Numbered phases, specific sources, synthesis needs, output format
    
    DEPTH SIGNALS:
    "Quick check:" / "Brief:" = concise | "Research:" / "Investigate:" = standard | 
    Multi-phase structure = comprehensive | "Check for updates:" = monitoring
    
    X PATTERNS:
    Expert opinions: from:expert1 OR from:expert2 topic
    Time-sensitive: topic since:2024-01-01 within_time:24h  
    High quality: topic min_faves:100 min_retweets:50
    Combined: (from:user1 OR from:user2) topic since:DATE min_faves:50 filter:verified -noise
    
    COMPLEX PROMPT STRUCTURE:
    [Goal] → [Context/why] → [Phase 1: action + sources] → [Phase 2: action + extraction] 
    → [Phase N: synthesis] → [Output: format/length/focus] → [Trail request if needed]
    
    CODE REQUESTS:
    Be specific: "Calculate CAGR using [data]" | Specify sources: "Use coingecko for 
    Bitcoin prices [dates]" or provide data | Request verification: "Verify claim [X] 
    using [method]" | Format: "Return as table/JSON/formatted"
    
    SYNTHESIS REQUESTS:
    Be explicit about what matters:
    "Synthesize: What's the consensus among experts?"
    "Analyze: Is this trend real or hype?"
    "Compare: Which option is better for [use case]?"
    "Evaluate: What are the risks vs benefits?"
    "Explain: Why do researchers disagree about this?"
    
    Specify perspectives: "Give both sides" | "Focus on practical not theory" | 
    "Decision-making insight not just facts"
    
    HANDLING UNCERTAINTY/CONFLICTS:
    When information might conflict:
    "Find claims about [X] and verify which are data-supported"
    "I've heard both [A] and [B] - investigate which is accurate"
    "Search for [topic] and note any disagreement among experts"
    
    Grok will: Search multiple perspectives, note conflicts, verify numerically when 
    possible, be explicit about confidence levels.
    
    OUTPUT FORMATTING:
    Control structure and presentation:
    "Structure as: Executive summary, detailed findings, conclusion"
    "Format as: Table comparing [items] by [attributes]"
    "Organize by: time period / category / source credibility"
    "Keep under 500 words but include all key points"
    "Be comprehensive - I want full detail on each item"
    
    Defaults: Clear headings, bullets, section separation, summaries when appropriate
    
    WHEN TO USE:
    ✓ Current info (<48h), expert opinions, sentiment analysis, verification, multi-source 
      synthesis, calculations, systematic research
    ✗ Trained knowledge, pure reasoning, creative writing, clarifying questions
    
    AVOID:
    ✗ Over-specifying tools (let Grok choose)
    ✗ Assuming memory (include context)  
    ✗ Vague scope (be specific)
    ✗ Missing time context for current events
    ✗ Setting async_mode=False (will cause timeout failures)
    
    ---
    EXAMPLES (adapt, don't copy)
    
    Simple: "Bitcoin price"
    
    Brief: "AI developments last 24h: X from @OpenAI @AnthropicAI @GoogleAI min_faves:50, 
    web headlines. 5 bullets <300w."
    
    Complex: "Due diligence [company]: 1) Site: products/team/model 2) Funding news/
    valuations 3) Code: revenue growth, margins, burn vs benchmarks 4) Competitors: 
    identify 3-5, compare 5) X: user sentiment (genuine not marketing) 6) X: analyst 
    opinions 7) Risks: regulatory/competitive/tech. Synthesize: strengths, concerns, 
    financial health, recommendation. Code for comparison matrices. Trail:True"
    
    Specialized: "Timeline [situation]: Origins (spark, dates) → primary sources (browse 
    docs) → evolution (X time-bounded for discourse shifts) → key players/positions → 
    current state. Code to organize chronologically. Full narrative with context for 
    why developments mattered."
